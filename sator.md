## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview

Please provide the following:

Sator.io and its native token, SAO, decentralize value in the television ecosystem to align the interests of all its participants. Series are able to engage and grow viewership by locking SAO in smart contracts that viewers unlock by watching tv. Viewers are able to earn, stake and spend SAO on voting, accessing rewards multipliers and collecting NFTs based on the show they're watching.

Sator is a decentralized application built on Ethereum and bridged to Polkadot and Solana. Sator activates with TV series partners who, at a basic level, lock rewards, in the form of SAO, into smart contracts for viewers to unlock via engagement with the shows. TV series who stake more, receive greater promotion to viewers. Viewers may also stake SAO to earn rewards multipliers, access exclusive content or buy/trade/display/create/sell NFTs based upon the shows they’re watching.


### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

Sator is the first productionized and decentralized application built on Ethereum with a bi-directional bridge to/from Solana, using the Wormhole implementation, and Polkadot, using Moonbeam implementation. Sator plans to bridge to other chains, including, but not limited to:  Polygon, Flow, Avalanche and more.
SAO is a utility token that powers the Sator Network, the first ever network that works horizontally with television streaming providers, content creators, and audiences alike. Sator is solving and building a fully scalable on-chain rewards system. No other project has touched this sphere successfully other than Basic Attention Token (though not all on-chain). The Sator Network leverages chains like Solana with low transaction speeds and scalability in order to accommodate the network effect that comes with large television-viewing audiences. Wrapping tokens from Sator’s native chain of Ethereum allows users to have next generation interoperability between chains. 
Sator allows audience superfans to engage with their favorite television series through staking their SAO on the platform for rewards multipliers, participating in series trivia challenges with friends all over the world, and collecting series-specific NFTs which they can flaunt on their user profiles. Sator brings real utility to NFTs on a platform where users  can interact with series in a brand new, connected way. We are disrupting the television and blockchain sphere simultaneously through complete gamification, interoperability and scalability across the platform. 


### Ecosystem Fit

* Bridging SAO from Ethereum to Polkadot (utilizing an existing bridge such as Moonbeam) will allow users of the Polkadot network to also become users of the Sator network
* Content Creators and users can stake their SAO and transfer them between chains
* Content Creators and Streaming giants have an unprecedented opportunity to create more value and buzz around their television series using our turnkey NFT solution, accessing a new audience vertical that is transparent and borderless.
* Flow - Sator is excited to offer a cross chain bridge solution to Flow where users can collect series specific NFTs, kill-a-character NFTs, access to never before seen clips and writer scripts.
* Superfans can unite in a brand new social network of all things television. Uniting audiences from all demographics, all over the world, audiences connect, content creators attract new viewers all while earning SAO rewards on the platform.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

* links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
* academic publications relevant to the problem,
* links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
* references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
* previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

## Future Plans

Sator plans to leverage Polygon (formerly Matic network) to grow an interoperable multi-chain environment. Sator is also building a superior recommender system that uses emotional based tagging and natural language processing / sentiment analysis to recommend shows to each and every one of our unique, dedicated user base. We will not prioritize certain shows just because they hold more SAO than another. Shows holding more SAO do see benefits in Staking rewards. However, decentralization is our top priority. It is extremely important that we achieve full decentralization, even among content creators, making it not possible for a show to overshadow other creators. In the future, Sator has plans to incorporate AR/VR “Easter Egg” hunts that rewards users interactively, as well as offering streaming subscription packages in SAO.
